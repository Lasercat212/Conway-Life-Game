# Conway-Life-Game
My first proyect in Python, the Conway's Life Game.

This proyect was created on Python 3.11, is a version of the Conway's Life Game:
Rules: 
Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
It makes a high beep every time a cell borns, and a lower beep every time a cell dies.
*Pause everytime you want to add cells*
